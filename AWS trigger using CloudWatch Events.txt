# AWS trigger using CloudWatch Events


To define time intervals for an AWS trigger using CloudWatch Events (now part of Amazon EventBridge), you can use either rate expressions or cron expressions
Hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to set them up:

1 - Rate Expressions
Rate expressions are used to run a rule at regular intervals. The syntax is:
rate(value unit)

value: A positive number.
unit: The unit of time (minute, minutes, hour, hours, day, days).

Examples:

rate(5 minutes) - Runs every 5 minutes.
rate(1 hour) - Runs every hour.


2 - Cron Expressions
Cron expressions provide more flexibility and precision. The syntax is:

cron(minutes hours day-of-month month day-of-week year)

minutes: 0-59
hours: 0-23
day-of-month: 1-31
month: 1-12 or JAN-DEC
day-of-week: 1-7 or SUN-SAT
year: 1970-2199 (optional)

Examples:

cron(0 12 * * ? *) - Runs at 12:00 PM (UTC) every day.
cron(15 10 ? * MON-FRI *) - Runs at 10:15 AM (UTC) every Monday to Friday.
