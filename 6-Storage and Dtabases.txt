@ Instance Stores and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)

Instance stores
Block-level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives.

An instance store(opens in a new tab) provides temporary block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance. An instance store is disk storage that is physically attached to the host computer for an EC2 instance, and therefore has the same lifespan as the instance. When the instance is terminated, you lose any data in the instance store.

@ Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
- Store data as a Object
- Store Object in Bucket
- Upload a maximuum object size of 5 TB
- Version object 
- Create Multiple Bucket

In object storage, each object consists of data, metadata, and a key.

The data might be an image, video, text document, or any other type of file. Metadata contains information about what the data is, how it is used, the object size, and so on. An object’s key is its unique identifier.

""" Recall that when you modify a file in block storage, only the pieces that are changed are updated. When a file in object storage is modified, the entire object is updated.  """

@ Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) : 
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a service that provides object-level storage. Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.

- You can upload any type of file to Amazon S3, such as images, videos, text files, and so on
- The maximum file size for an object in Amazon S3 is 5 TB.
- When you upload a file to Amazon S3, you can set permissions to control visibility and access to it. You can also use the Amazon S3 versioning feature to track changes to 
  your objects over time.

@ Amazon S3 storage classes : 
1 ) Amazon S3 Standard (S3 Standard) : S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data. Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, S3 Standard is appropriate for a wide variety of use cases, including cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics. 

2) Amazon S3 Standard-Inpfrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) :
- Ideal for infrequently accessed data
- Similar to Amazon S3 Standard but has a lower storage price and higher retrieval price
- Amazon S3 Standard-IA is ideal for data infrequently accessed but requires high availability when needed. Both Amazon S3 Standard and Amazon S3 Standard-IA store data in a 
  minimum of three Availability Zones.

3) S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access ( S3 One Zone-IA) : 
- Stores data in a single Availability Zone
- Has a lower storage price than Amazon S3 Standard-IA
- compared to S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA, which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones, S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single Availability Zone.
This makes it a good storage class to consider if the following conditions apply:
- You want to save costs on storage.
- You can easily reproduce your data in the event of an Availability Zone failure

4) S3 Intelligent-Tiering : 
- Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns
- Requires a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object
- In the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class, Amazon S3 monitors objects’ access patterns. If you haven’t accessed an object for 30 consecutive days, Amazon S3 
  automatically moves it to the infrequent access tier, S3 Standard-IA. If you access an object in the infrequent access tier, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the 
  frequent access tier, S3 Standard.

5) Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval : 
- Works well for archived data that requires immediate access
- Can retrieve objects within a few milliseconds

6) Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly S3 Glacier) : 
- Low-cost storage designed for data archiving
- Able to retrieve objects within a few minutes to hours
- Glacier Flexible Retrieval is a low-cost storage class that is ideal for data archiving. 


7) S3 Deep Archive : 
- Lowest-cost object storage class ideal for archiving
- Able to retrieve objects within 12 hours
- S3 Deep Archive supports long-term retention and digital preservation for data that might be accessed once or twice in a year. This storage class is the lowest-cost 
  storage in the AWS Cloud, with data retrieval from 12 to 48 hours. All objects from this storage class are replicated and stored across at least three geographically 
  dispersed Availability Zones.

8) S3 Outposts : 
- Creates S3 buckets on Amazon S3 Outposts
- Makes it easier to retrieve, store, and access data on AWS Outposts
- mazon S3 Outposts delivers object storage to your on-premises AWS Outposts environment. Amazon S3 Outposts is designed to store data durably and redundantly across 
  multiple devices and servers on your Outposts. It works well for workloads with local data residency requirements that must satisfy demanding performance needs by keeping 
  data close to on-premises applications.
