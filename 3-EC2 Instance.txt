1) What is instance?
    An instance is a virtual server for running applications on amazon EC2. It can also be understood like a tiny part of a larger computer, a tiny part which has its own hard drive, network connection, OS etc. But it is actually all virtual.
    When you are launching a virtual machine, it is called as instance in terms of AWS 
    
2) What is EC2?
    Amazon Elastic Compute EC2 is a web service from amazon that provides resizable compute services in the cloud
    It is highly flexible and scalable  

3) Types of instances: -
1.General purpose response
    It is basically suited for applications that require a balance a performance and cost.
    That means places where you require quick response but it is still cost effective

2.Compute instances
    for that applications that require a lot of processing 
    Computation they have better computation power. That means if there is a lot of data that need quicker computation power you can use these kinds of instances.
    Ex Analyzing streaming data (it the data that continuously flows in and flows out) 

3.Memory instance
    For applications that are heavy in nature therefore require a lot of RAMS

4.Storage instances
    For application that are huge size or have a data set that occupies lot of space

5.GPU instance
    For applications that require some heavy graphics rendering
