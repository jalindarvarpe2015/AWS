# Lambda Function in AWS 

AWS Lambda :
lets you run code without thinking about servers.
You pay only for the compute time that you consume â€” there is no charge when your code is not running.
With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration.

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
It automatically scales your applications by running code in response to triggers such as changes in data, shifts in system state, or user actions.


Key Limitations of AWS Lambda:
- Execution Time: The maximum execution time for a Lambda function is 15 minutes. This makes it unsuitable for long-running processes.

- Function Size: The maximum size of a deployed Lambda function package is 250 MB (unzipped), including layers.

- Language Support: AWS Lambda natively supports a limited set of programming languages, though you can bring your own runtime.
